The core of SolCerberus is the app, which manages roles and permissions and enforces the 
access rules for a Solana program.

1. Go to the [SC manager](https://solcerberus.com/app)
2. Click **Create New App**
3. Type a name for the app 
4. Optional: Enter the address for a recovery wallet
5. Click Accept and sign the transaction

{: .important }
We strongly recommend entering a recovery wallet that is independent of the main wallet.

{: .note}
If you're using SolCerberus as part of another application, the SolCerberus app might be created for you automatically through that application.
