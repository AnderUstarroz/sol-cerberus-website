In order to control access to an app, at least one Role is necessary. Roles are simply text strings 
(names). The role is assigned to a Wallet, the owner of a specific NFT, or all owners of NFTs belonging
to a collection. 

## Assign role
Click Assign Role, pick a name, type of address and enter the address. 

Role assignments can be temporary, click the checkbox and set an UTC time at which the role assignment 
will expire. 

{: .note }
You can assign the same role to several wallets/NFTs/Collections, or any mix thereof. Click Add, next to 
the role name, or use Assign and enter the same role name again.
