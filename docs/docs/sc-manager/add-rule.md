Permission Rules are the link that defines what the holder of a specific role can do.

## Resources and Permissions
The permission defines which action can be performed on which resource by which role. Sol Cerberus allows defining any combination of roles, resources and permissions, allowing fine-grained access management. 

Permissions can be added as temporary by clicking the checkbox when creating them.

{: .note }
Example. Allow guests to open the door, assign a permission rule as... 
Role: Guest, Resource: Door, Permission: Open

{: .note }
Using the Add buttons next to roles or resources helps quickly adding multiple similar rules.
